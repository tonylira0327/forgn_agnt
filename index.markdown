# Introduction

FARA, or the Foreign Agent Registration Act, is a law passed in 1938. Its main purpose is to enforce transparency of foreign agents, who are persons influenced by a foreign principal. As defined by FARA’s official documentation a foreign principal is “(1) a government of a foreign country and a foreign political party; (2) a person outside of the United States unless it is established that such person is a citizen of and domiciled within the United States or (...) organized under or created by the laws of the United States (...); (3) a combination of persons organized under the laws of or having its principal place of business in a foreign country”[^1]. FARA fell into obscurity following the World War II period, experiencing a resurgence in 2016.

All of the sources that are included in this publication are newspaper articles, specifically from the first few years of its inception, 1938, and relate to the many cases that saw FARA called upon. While not providing new information to the covered cases, these newspapers are a unique source that provides readers with unique dialogues of the time. Specifically, the newspapers' biases and choices regarding emphasis. In certain areas, demonstrate the early understanding of FARA, its uses, and its consequences. The newspapers vary in what times they were published, but all fall within the period of FARA and the end of WW2, with the latest newspaper being published in 1944. For further context, there is a more detailed history of FARA in the About this source section.

# About this Source

### Early History

Concern over foreign influence has been on the mind of the United States since the time of Washington. In his farewell address, George Washington expressed his concerns over the power foreign influences could have over the US. Washington states, “the jealousy of a free people ought to be constantly awake, since history and experience prove that foreign influence is one of the most baneful foes of republican government.”[^2]

FARA’s history officially begins, however, in 1917, with the creation of the Overman committee. The Overman Committee was a precursor of what would eventually become the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC). One of the main concerns of the committee was the American Brewers League; mainly, they were concerned with investigating the connection between the league and Germany[^3]. In a final report, which they published as an interview with The New York Times, the committee spoke on the league's connection to Germany; however, what they also discovered was the league's use of its funds as a way to manipulate American policy. It’s here that we see the acknowledgement of the threat foreign propaganda poses. 

Investigations of foreign influences would receive results again in 1935, with the McCormack-Dickinson committee, a continuation of the Overman and Fish committees, when they published their own report regarding foreign influences.  In the report, the committee writes, “a statute requiring all publicity, propaganda, or public-relations agents or other agents or agencies who represent (...) any foreign government (...) to register with the Secretary of State of the United States”[^4]. While the law would not be passed until three years later, FARA would be passed in 1938. Within the report, FARA was proposed as a response to the growing number of Nazi and Communist propagandists throughout the United States. 

Among the cases from before the US entered the war, a majority were against the growing German propaganda within the US. The first official case, however, was against the Russian government and its propaganda efforts in the US, which was one of our sources.

### Wartime Applications

During the Second World War, FARA was used in a role of direct counteraction to foreign propaganda and influence in the United States. The years between 1941 and 1945 saw a huge uptick in cases, with a higher rate of criminal cases being opened for FARA violations than at any other time. The Second World War also saw a decrease in instances against Communist propagandists from places like the USSR, with no criminal cases between 1941 and 1945 being against a Russian-linked person or organization[^5]. Soviet propaganda efforts in the US during the Second World War experienced a massive change, now promoting the idea of US-USSR cooperation and their military alliance. This tonal shift was also seen in how Soviet propaganda efforts were directed, with a shift to direct USSR government-sponsored tours and working directly with American entities to produce propaganda[^6]. 

Most cases were against agents of the Nazi German Third Reich, which had a far greater public propaganda presence in the United States than any other Axis power. In total, 14 criminal cases were opened against persons or organizations for violations of FARA from 1941 to 1945, with 9 of these cases being against persons or organizations connected to Nazi Germany[^7]. In this edition, our sources cover 3 cases about individuals and organizations linked to Nazi Germany, being those of George Viereck, Laura Ingalls, and the German-American Vocational League. In all three cases, the people involved were also connected to pro-German and/or anti-war propaganda or publishing and had some form of arrangement to accept money from the German Government or related entity, and had failed to register as a Foreign Agent. All of these cases received major media attention and publication. Viereck, Ingalls, and all 27 members of the Vocational League who were arrested are mentioned by name across several period sources from across several states and publishing agencies[^9]. In the 1940s, newspapers were still the primary form of new media in the United States, and though less popular than in years before, due to new systems like the radio, in 1940, over 41 million newspapers were circulated every weekday. In particular, the case against the German-American Vocational League was major news as it was the largest wartime case and received major reporting, especially from the New York Times. Viereck and Ingalls were already known in the media due to previous events in their lives. Ingalls was known for being a pilot[^10], while Viereck was already well known as publicly pro–German[^11]. Throughout these articles, the tone is often accusatory and critical of those involved, and especially of those convinced by the newspapers, clearly labeling them as assets of the enemy governments.
The other wartime case this edition will cover is that of the so-called "Tokyo Six” or the Japanese Committee on Trade and Information. This was the only wartime criminal case opened for a FARA violation in relation to the Empire of Japan[^12]. In addition, this case was not opened on charges of a failure to register as a Foreign Agent but rather on the basis that false information had been given to the Federal Government while doing so[^13]. Just like with the German-connected individuals and organizations, the Japanese Committee on Trade and Information had been an active publisher of pro-Japanese material to disseminate amongst the American people. This case had a major media presence with widespread reporting in several newspapers, including outside of California[14].

# About this Edition

Our material strictly consists of newspapers from The NewYork Times, all from the timeframe of FARA’s passing in 1938 until the end of WW2; all of the newspapers cover FARA-related cases of suspected foreign interference. Newspapers were found via the UIUC library, inside the newspaper library’s microfilm collection. The displayed sources were input through scanning them from the school library. All of our news sources are in decent, readable condition. We are not intending to transcribe them; we will publish them as they are. We will add context where it is lacking or where newspapers assume knowledge of the period and its associated political and social climate. Our edition is specifically concerned with the early years of FARA. In selecting our sources, we aim to provide a useful starting point for future research on FARA’s origins, beginnings, and application in combating foreign propaganda. Especially during its early years, FARA’s scope was not well defined. This was further complicated by the tumultuous World War II period. Overall, our focus for this digital documentary is on how FARA was actually used in its early years. Each case in our newspapers represents different applications of the law during the war period. The Bookniga case represents the foreign interference of Soviet communism within the United States, and specifically within publishing companies and media. The German Vocational League represents the fear of the imposition of Nazism during the war, as the German-influenced activities are a significant reason the McCormack and Dies Committees created the Foreign Agent Registration Act. The Tokyo Six were indicted after Pearl Harbor, targeting propaganda in support of Japan. We also wanted to highlight instances of usage against individuals, such as Laura Ingalls or George Viereck. Many of these newspapers are snippets of larger stories, so we will add understanding of arrests or outcomes, legal or social. While there will be no alterations to the source content, there will be alterations to the source look. Only minor changes will be made to how the sources are presented, namely, cutting and reformatting them so that they are more easily readable.
