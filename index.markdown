# Introduction

{% include media_next.html pages=media %}

Word count: 250–450 words

This is the first written element of an edition: the first content readers encounter.

The purpose of this introduction is to set the scene: to provide an initial description of the source as well as an overview your edition, highlighting its features and supplements. This is not a space for much detail about the source or our editorial work with it. Later sections will allow you to do that. Here, your job is to help readers understand that they are looking at a digital edition of a historical source and why that source is interesting.

The premium is on precise, no-nonsense prose.

At bottom, you should include:

**How to Cite:**
Here, provide a citation using this model:

> Lastname, Firstname, FirstName LastName, and FirstName, Lastname. “Title of Web Page.” Name of Website (if different from web page). Publication or Revision Date. URL.

Your teams have multiple authors.  In scholarship, if authorship is equal across all team members, then the custom is to list by last name them in alphabetical order.  If you wish to deviate from this order you can but that will communicate priority (i.e. that the one who goes first is the 'lead author', etc.).

If you choose and wish to do so, you may also include a Creative Commons license here. We'll discuss those in class.

Here and throughout your edition, you should use footnotes in Chicago Notes and Bibliography style.[^1]  Please note that if sources are listed in your bibliography (and all your main ones should be), you may use a shortened form in these notes (e.g. Smith, _Towards a Better Understanding_, 5, with the full citation to Smith going in the bibliography).

# The Source

This section provides the main presentation of your source, as you have prepared it for readers (i.e., a facsimile, transcription, video, audio clip, etc.). This section is where we satisfy the first of the ADE’s three criteria for an electronic edition by providing a rigorous, accurate presentation of historical material.

For the presentation of some sources, it may make sense to break up the presentation into multiple pages. For that, as needed, we can use a more book like template (binding multiple pages together) that I can provide. Nonetheless, this page should be the page from which all presentations of the source itself start.

This may also be a space where editorial annotations are provided, such as notes on provenance, archival location, transcription, and more. If possible, a link to the source’s permanent digital location should be included here as well as a citation for that location. This should be done in consultation with the instructors, editorial board, and peer reviewers.

Please note: some presentations may benefit from a multipage format (rather than one scrolling page, as here). I can make a multipage template available to you as needed.

# About this Source

Word count: 1000 words (excluding footnotes)

This section contains a short biography or history of your source. This section helps readers understand the context in which the source was made, and the kinds of historical topics and questions it illuminates.  It also helps to satisfy the second of the ADE’s "Minimum Standards for Electronic Editions," explanatory annotation.

"About this Source" should answer questions like:

    How, when, and where was this artifact created?
    For what purpose? To what effect?
    Who used it, when, where, why?
    What sorts of histories and historical debates has it been used in? How might we use it in our explorations of the past today?

To answer these questions, you will be drawing on your collective research for the Research Assignment.

The target length of this section is about 1000 words, exclusive of notes. It should contain footnotes that substantiate and support your research into the artifact and its history. Here, as throughout, the focus should be on clean, clear prose.

Introduction - 

FARA, or the Foreign Agent Registration Act, is a law passed in 1938. Its main purpose is to enforce transparency of foreign agents, who are persons influenced by a foreign principal. As defined by FARA’s official documentation a foreign principal is “(1) a government of a foreign country and a foreign political party; (2) a person outside of the United States unless it is established that such person is a citizen of and domiciled within the United States or (...) organized under or created by the laws of the United States (...); (3) a combination of persons organized under the laws of or having its principal place of business in a foreign country”. FARA fell into obscurity following the World War II period, experiencing a resurgence in 2016. During the WW2 period, however, FARA saw frequent use. All of the sources that are included in this publication are newspaper articles from this era and relate to the many cases that saw FARA called upon. In the following section, we’ll go over a summary of the major events in FARA’s early history.

Early years -

Concern over foreign influence has been on the mind of the United States since the time of Washington. In his farewell address, George Washington expressed his concerns over the power foreign influences could have over the US. Washington states, “the jealousy of a free people ought to be constantly awake, since history and experience prove that foreign influence is one of the most baneful foes of republican government.” FARA’s history officially begins, however, in 1917, with the creation of the Overman committee. The Overman Committee was a precursor of what would eventually become the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC). One of the main concerns of the committee was the American Brewers League; mainly, they were concerned with investigating the connection between the league and Germany. In a final report, which they published as an interview with The New York Times, the committee spoke on the league's connection to Germany; however, what they also discovered was the league's use of its funds as a way to manipulate American policy. It’s here where we see the acknowledgement of the threat foreign propaganda poses. Investigations of foreign influences would receive results again in 1935, with the McCormack-Dickinson committee, a continuation of the Overman and Fish committees, when they published their own report regarding foreign influences.  In the report, the committee writes, “a statute requiring all publicity, propaganda, or public-relations agents or other agents or agencies who represent (...) any foreign government (...) to register with the Secretary of State of the United States”. While the law would not be passed until three years later, FARA would be passed in 1938. Within the report, FARA was proposed as a response to the growing number of Nazi and Communist propagandists throughout the United States. Before the United States entered the war, there were three cases involving FARA, all of which were regarding two companies and their failure to register as foreign agents of Communist Russia. 

Wartime applications -

Wartime Applications - During the Second World War, FARA was used in a role of direct counteraction to foreign propaganda and influence in the United States. The years between 1941 and 1945 saw a huge uptick in cases, with a higher rate of criminal cases being opened for FARA violations than at any other time. Most cases were against agents of the Nazi German Third Reich, which had a far greater public propaganda presence in the United States than any other Axis power. The Second World War also saw a decrease of cases against Communist propagandists from places like the USSR with no criminal cases between 1941 and 1945 being against a Russian linked persons or organizations, this was most likely in part both due to a decrease in Soviet funding for propaganda operations in the US and the Federal Government being less willing than in the prewar to prosecute people for connections to its Wartime ally. In total, 14 criminal cases were opened against persons or organizations for violations of FARA from 1941-1945, with 9 of these cases being around persons or organizations connected to Nazi Germany. In this edition, our sources cover 3 cases pertaining to individuals and organizations linked to Nazi Germany, being those of George Viereck, Laura Ingalls, and the German-American Vocational League. In all three cases, the primary charges against these persons and organizations were a failure to register as a Foreign Agent. All three of these cases received media attention and resulted in convictions. In all three cases, the people involved were also connected to pro-German and/or anti-war propaganda or publishing and had some form of arrangement to accept money from the German Government or related entity. The other wartime case this edition will cover is that of the so-called "Tokyo Six” or the Japanese Committee on Trade and Information. This was the only wartime criminal case opened for a FARA violation in relation to the Empire of Japan. In addition, this case was not opened on charges of a failure to register as a Foreign Agent but rather on the basis that false information had been given to the Federal Government while doing so. Just like with the German connected individuals and organizations, the Japanese Committee on Trade and Information had been an active publisher of pro-Japanese material to disseminate amongst the American people. During the Second World War, the Foreign Agent Registration Act was used as a direct counter-propaganda tool against important or influential pro-Axis voices and directly contributed to the information war as a way to further control information and prevent Axis propaganda from spreading amongst the US populace.
